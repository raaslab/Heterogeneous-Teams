TODO's

% Create cluster plotter
% Create something that adds the starting/ending node. (the base station for the graph)
% Create the tour of the UAV (created from the output of the GTSP graph)
% Create the tour of the UGV
% Correct the UAV tour by correcting GTSP solver
% Add other characteristic to nodes to define levels in solver (add battery level characteristic so we can obtain the UGV) (BECAME UNNECESSARY BECAUSE OF HOW I CREATED UGV TOUR)
% Create function that allows the program run on the robots (ended up not doing this because we aren't doing online yet)
% createBaseStation function
% createUAVTour function
% figure out bugs that came from createBaseStation.m
% Run specificRuns.m first to figure out if everything is working correctly, the UAV and UGV tour
% Run multipleRuns.m second to get all the correct .mat files and information
% Finish function graphClusterOrdered.m
% Finish function plotsForPaper.m
% Clearn up the workspace files so that they have more meaningful names
put the makingSTWv_Adj into the main test file
run after implementing makingSTWv_Adj
