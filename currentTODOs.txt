% Create the tour of the UAV (created from the output of the GTSP graph)
% Create the tour of the UGV
Correct the UAV tour by correcting GTSP solver
% Add other characteristic to nodes to define levels in solver (add battery level characteristic so we can obtain the UGV) (BECAME UNNECESSARY BECAUSE OF HOW I CREATED UGV TOUR)
